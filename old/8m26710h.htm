    <p>Hadley, Mankin, or Monkton, Hadley, was formerly a hamlet to Edmonton. It lies
    north-west of Enfield, and comprises 580 acres, including 240 allotted in lieu of the
    common enclosure of Enfield Chase. Its name is compounded of two Saxon
    words&mdash;Head-leagh, or a high place; Mankin is probably derived from the
    connexion of the place with the abbey of Walden, to which it was given by Geoffrey de
    Mandeville, earl of Essex, under the name of the Hermitage of Hadley. The village is
    situated on the east side of the great north road, eleven miles from London.</p>
    <p>The manor belonged to the Mandevilles, the founder of the Hermitage, and was given
    by Geoffrey to the monks of Walden; in the ensuing two centuries the manorial
    property underwent various transmissions, and was purchased by the Pinney family, in
    the year 1791, by the present proprietor, Peter Moore, Esq.</p>
    <p>The house of the late David Garrow, father to the present judge of that name in
    the court of exchequer, is supposed to have been connected with a monastic
    establishment. Chimney-pieces remain in <i>alto-relievo</i>: on one is sculptured the
    story of Sampson; the other represents many passages in the life of our Saviour, from
    his birth in the stall to his death on the cross.</p>
    <p>The parish church, of which our engraving gives a correct view, is a handsome
    structure, built at different periods. The chancel bears marks of great antiquity,
    but the body has been built with bricks. At the west end is a square tower, composed
    of flint, with quoins of freestone; on one side is the date Anno Domini 1393, cut in
    stone&mdash;one side of the stone bearing date in the sculptured device of a wing;
    the other that of a rose. The figures denote the year 1494; the last, like the second
    numerical, being the <i>half eight</i>, often used in ancient inscriptions. The
    unique vestige of the middle ages, namely, a firepan, or pitchpot, on the south-west
    tower of the church, was blown down in January, 1779 and carefully repaired, though
    now not required for the purpose of giving an alarm at the approach of a foe, by
    lighting pitch within it. The church has been supposed to have been erected by Edward
    IV. as a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>chapel
    for religious service, to the memory of those who fell in the battle of Barnet in
    1471.</p>
    <p>On the window of the north transcept are some remains of painted glass, among
    which may be noticed the rebus of the Gooders, a family of considerable consequence
    at Hadley in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. This consists of a partridge with
    an ear of wheat in its bill; on an annexed scroll is the word Gooder; on the capital
    of one of the pillars are two partridges with ears of corn in the mouth, an evident
    repetition of the same punning device, and it is probable the Gooder's were
    considerable benefactors towards building the church.</p>
    <p>The almshouses for six decayed housekeepers were founded by Sir Roger Willbraham
    in 1616, but so slenderly endowed that they do not produce more than 9l.6s. annually.
    Major Delafonte, in 1762, increased the annuity, which expired in 1805; but Mr.
    Cottrell gained by subscription 2375l. in trust. The father of the late Mr.
    Whitbread, the statesman, subscribed the sum of 1000l. for the support of the
    almshouses. The charity-school for girls was established in 1773, and was enlarged
    and converted into a school of industry in 1800. Twenty girls in the establishment
    receive annually the sum of 1l. towards clothing; thirty girls besides the above are
    admitted to the benefit of education, on paying the weekly sum of 2d. and succeed to
    the vacancies which occur in the class more largely assisted. This charity is in like
    manner supported by contributions on the inhabitants. The boys' school, supported in
    the same way, which in 1804 amounted to the sum of 103l. 10s., has about seventy
    day-scholars; twenty are allowed 1l. towards clothing, and instructed without any
    charge; the remainder pay 2d. weekly.</p>

    <h2>THE SKETCH BOOK.</h2>
    <h4>NO. XLIII.</h4>
    <hr />
    <h3>THE BUTCHER.</h3>
    <p>Wolsey, they tell us, was a butcher. An alliterative couplet too was made upon him
    to that import:&mdash;</p>
    <blockquote class="poetry">
      "By butchers born, by bishops bred,<br />
      How high his honour holds his haughty head."<br />
    </blockquote>
    <p>Notwithstanding which, however, and other similar allusions, there have arisen
    many disputes touching the veracity of the assertion; yet, doubtless, those who first
    promulgated the idea, were keen observers of men and manners; and, probably, in the
    critical examination of the Cardinal's character, discovered a particular trait which
    indubitably satisfied them of his origin.</p>
    <p>Be this as it may, I am inclined to think there is certainly something peculiarly
    characteristic in the butcher.</p>
    <p>The pursuit of his calling appears to have an influence upon his manners, speech,
    and dress. Of all the days in the week, Saturday is the choicest for seeing him to
    the best advantage. His hatless head, shining with grease, his cheeks as ruddy as his
    mutton-chops, his sky-blue frock and dark-blue apron, his dangling steel and
    sharp-set knife, which ever and anon play an accompaniment to his quick,
    short&mdash;"Buy! buy!" are all in good keeping with the surrounding objects. And
    although this be not <i>killing</i> day with him, he is particularly winning and
    gracious with the serving-maids; who (whirling the large street-door key about their
    right thumb, and swinging their marketing basket in their left hand) view the
    well-displayed joints, undecided which to select, until Mr. Butcher recommends a leg
    or a loin; and then he so very politely cuts off the fat, in which his skilful hand
    is guided by the high or low price of mutton fat in the market. He is the very
    antipode of a fop, yet no man knows how to show a handsome <i>leg</i> off to better
    advantage, or is prouder of his <i>calves</i>.</p>
    <p>In his noviciate, when he shoulders the shallow tray, and whistles cavalierly on
    his way in his sausage-meat-complexioned-jacket, there is something marked as well in
    his character as his <i>habits</i>, he is never <i>moved</i> to stay, except by a
    brother butcher, or a fight of dogs or boys, for such scenes fit his singular fancy.
    Then, in the discussion of his bull-dog's beauties, he becomes extraordinarily
    eloquent. Hatiz, the Persian, could not more warmly, or with choicer figure, describe
    his mistress' charms, than he does Lion's, or Fowler's, or whatever the brute's
    Christian name may be; and yet the surly, cynical, <i>dogged</i> expression of the
    bepraised beast, would almost make one imagine he understood the meaning of his
    master's words, and that his honest nature despised the flattering encomiums he
    passes upon his pink belly and legs, his broad chest, his ring-tail, and his tulip
    ears!&mdash;<i>Absurdities, in Prose and Verse.</i></p>

    <h3>CONFIDENCE AND CREDIT.</h3>
    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
    <blockquote class="poetry">
      The day was dark, the markets dull,<br />
      The Change was thin, Gazettes were full,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;And half the town was breaking;<br />
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>The
      <i>counter-sign</i> of Cash was "<i>Stop</i>!"<br />
      Bankers and bankrupts shut up shop,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;And honest hearts were aching.<br />
      <br />
      When near the Bench my fancy spied<br />
      A faded form, with hasty stride,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath Grief's burden stooping:<br />
      Her name was CREDIT, and she said<br />
      Her father, TRADE, was lately dead,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother, COMMERCE, drooping.<br />
      <br />
      The smile that she was wont to wear<br />
      Was wither'd by the hand of care,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes had lost their lustre:<br />
      Her character was gone, she said,<br />
      For she had basely been betray'd,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;And nobody would trust her.<br />
      <br />
      For honest INDUSTRY had tried<br />
      To gain fair CREDIT for his bride,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;And found the damsel willing,<br />
      But, ah! a <i>fortune-hunter</i> came,<br />
      And SPECULATION was his name,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;A rake not worth a shilling.<br />
      <br />
      The villain came, on mischief bent,<br />
      And soon gain'd dad and mam's consent&mdash;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! then poor CREDIT smarted;&mdash;<br />
      He filch'd her fortune and her fame,<br />
      He fix'd a blot upon her name,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;And left her broken-hearted.<br />
      <br />
      While thus poor CREDIT seem'd to sigh,<br />
      Her cousin, CONFIDENCE, came by&mdash;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;(Methinks he must be clever)&mdash;<br />
      For, when he whisper'd in her ear,<br />
      She check'd the sigh, she dried the tear.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled as sweet as ever!<br />

    <h3>CURIOUS SCRAPS RELATING TO CELEBRATED PERSONS.</h3>
    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
    <p>When the famous Cornelia, daughter of the great Scipio, was importuned by a lady
    of her acquaintance to show her toilette, she deferred satisfying her curiosity till
    her children, who were the famous Gracchi, came from school, and then said, "<i>En!
    haec ornamenta mea sunt.</i>"&mdash;"These are my ornaments."</p>
    <p>Cyneas, the minister of Pyrrhus, asked the king (before their expedition into
    Italy) what he proposed to do when he had subdued the Romans? He answered, "Pass into
    Sicily." "What then?" said the minister. "Conquer the Carthaginians," replied the
    king. "And what follows that?" says the minister. "Be sovereign of Greece, and then
    enjoy ourselves," said the king. "And why," replied the sensible minister, "can we
    not do this <i>last</i> now?"</p>
    <p>The emperors Nerva, Trajan, Antoninous, and Aurelius sold their palaces, their
    gold and silver plate, their valuable furniture, and other superfluities, heaped up
    by their predecessors, and banished from their tables all expensive delicacies. These
    princes, together with Vespasian, Pertinax, Alexander, Severus, Claudius the Second,
    and Tacitus, who were raised to the empire by their merit, and whom all ages have
    admired as the greatest and the best of princes, were always fond of the greatest
    plainness in their apparel, furniture, and outward appearance.</p>
    <p>Cortez, the conqueror of Mexico, who lived unknown and disgraced in Spain, was
    scarcely able to obtain an audience of his master Charles V.; and when the king asked
    who was the fellow that was so clamorous to speak to him, he cried out, "I am one who
    have got your majesty more provinces than your father left towns."</p>
    <p>Camoens, the famous Portuguese poet, was unfortunately shipwrecked at the mouth of
    the river Meco, on the coast of Camboja, and lost his whole property; however, he
    saved his life and his poems, which he bore through the waves in one hand, whilst he
    swam ashore with the other. It is said, that his black servant, a native of Java, who
    had been his companion for many years, begged in the Streets of Lisbon for the
    support of his master, who died in 1579. His death, it is supposed, was accelerated
    by the anguish with which he foresaw the ruin impending over his country. In one of
    his letters he uses these remarkable expressions: "I am ending the course of my life;
    the world will witness how I have loved my country. I have returned not only to die
    in her bosom, but to die with her."</p>
    <p>Henrietta, daughter of Henry IV. of France, and wife of Charles I. of England, was
    reduced to the utmost poverty; and her daughter, afterwards married to a brother of
    Louis XIV., is said to have lain in bed for want of coals to keep her warm. Pennant
    relates a melancholy fact of fallen majesty in the person of Mary d'Este, the unhappy
    queen of James II., who, flying with her infant prince from the ruin impending over
    their house, after crossing the Thames from abdicated Whitehall, took shelter beneath
    the ancient walls of Lambeth church a whole hour, from the rain of the inclement
    night of December 6th, 1688. Here she waited with aggravated misery till a common
    coach, procured from the next inn, arrived, and conveyed her to Gravesend, from
    whence she sailed, and bid adieu to this kingdom.</p>
    <p>Pascal, one of the greatest geniuses and best men that ever lived, entertained a
    notion that God made men miserable here in order to their being happy hereafter; and
    in consequence of this notion, he imposed upon himself the most painful <span
    class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>mortification. He even
    ordered a wall to be built before a window in his study, which afforded him too
    agreeable a prospect. He had also a girdle full of sharp points next his skin; and
    while he was eating or drinking any thing that was grateful to his palate, he was
    constantly pricking himself, that he might not be sensible of any pleasure. The
    virtuous Fenelon submitted without reserve to the arbitrary sentence of the pope,
    when he condemned a book which he had published, and even preached in condemnation of
    his own book, forbidding his friends to defend it. "What gross and humiliating
    superstitions (says their biographer) have been manifested by men, in other respects
    of sound and clear understandings, and of upright, honest hearts."</p>
    <p>In the churchyard of St. Ann's, Soho, says Pennant, is a marble, erected near the
    grave of that remarkable personage, Theodore Antony Newhoff, king of Corsica, who
    died in this parish in 1756, immediately after leaving the king's-bench prison, by
    the benefit of the act of insolvency. The marble was erected, and the epitaph
    written, by the honourable Horace Walpole:&mdash;</p>
    "The grave, great teacher, to a level brings<br />
    Heroes and beggars, galley-slaves and kings;<br />
    But Theodore this moral learn'd ere dead&mdash;<br />
    Fate pour'd its lesson on his living head,<br />
    Bestow'd a kingdom, and denied him bread."<br />

    <p>He registered his kingdom of Corsica for the use of his creditors. His biographer
    says, "He was a man whose claim to royalty was as indisputable as the most ancient
    titles to any monarchy can pretend to be; that is, the choice of his subjects, the
    voluntary election of an injured people, who had the common right of mankind to
    freedom, and the uncommon resolution of determining to be free."</p>

    <h3>"THE LILY BELLS ARE WET WITH DEW."</h3>
    <h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have taken the liberty of transmitting to you a piece of a Latin ode,
    which appears to me to be the original of the song&mdash;"The lily bells are wet with
    dew," in Miss Mitford's "Dramatic Scenes," which appeared in your miscellany of June
    23, 1827.</p>
    <p>It is copied from an old book published in the year 1697, by Charles Elford,
    entitled "Gemmae Poetarum."</p>

    <h2>ASTRONOMICAL OCCURRENCES FOR AUGUST, 1827.</h2>
    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
    <p>It has been computed, that all the celestial orbs perceived by the unassisted eye
    (which on a clear night never exceed 1,000,) do not form the 80,000 part of those
    which may be descried by the help of a telescope, through which they appear
    prodigiously increased in number; seventy stars have been counted in the
    constellation of the <i>pleiades</i>, and no fewer than 2,000 in that of
    <i>Orion</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>galaxy</i>, or <i>via lactea</i>, (milky way,) is a remarkable appearance
    in the heavens, being a broad ray of whitish colour surrounding the whole celestial
    concave, whose light proceeds from vast clusters of stars, discoverable only by the
    telescope. Mr. Brydone, in his journey to the top of Mount Etna, found the phenomenon
    make a most glorious appearance, "like a pure flame that shot across the
    heavens."</p>
    <p>Dr. Herschel made many observations on this portion of the heavens, using a
    Newtonian reflector of twenty feet focal length, and an aperture of eighteen inches.
    With this powerful telescope he completely resolved the whitish appearance into
    stars, which the telescopes he had formerly used had not light enough to do. In the
    most vacant place to be met with in that neighbourhood, he found sixty-three stars;
    other six fields, or apparent spaces in the heavens, which he could see at once
    through his telescope, averaged seventy-nine stars in each field: thus he found that
    by allowing 15 min. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>[pg
    85]</span>of a deg. for the diameter of his field of view, a belt of 15 deg. long,
    and 2 deg. broad, which he had often seen pass before his telescope in an hour's time
    could not contain less than 50,000 stars, large enough to be distinctly numbered,
    besides which he suspected twice as many more, which could be seen only now and then
    by faint glimpses, for want of sufficient light. In the most crowded part of that
    region he informs us, he has had fields of view which contained no less than 588
    stars, and these were continued for many minutes, so that in one quarter of an hour's
    time there passed no less than 116,000 stars. He also intimates the probability of
    the sun being placed in this great stratum, though perhaps not in the very centre of
    its thickness.</p>
    <p>From the appearance of the galaxy it seems to encompass the whole heavens, as it
    certainly must if the sun be within the same. From succeeding observations made by
    Dr. Herschel, he gathers that the milky way is a most extensive stratum of stars of
    various sizes, and our sun evidently one of the heavenly bodies belonging to it. In
    viewing and gauging this shining zone in almost every direction, he found the number
    of stars composing it, by the account of those gauges constantly increase and
    decrease in proportion to its apparent brightness to the naked eye.</p>
    <p>The <i>nebul&aelig;</i>, or small whitish specks, discoverable by telescopes in
    various parts of the heavens are owing to the same cause. Former astronomers could
    only reckon 103, but Herschel counts upwards of 1,250. He has also discovered a
    species of them, which he calls planetary nebul&aelig;, on account of their

    <h2>THE NOVELIST.</h2>
    <h4>NO. CVI.</h4>
    <hr />
    <h3>ROSALIE BERTON.</h3>
    <h4>(<i>Concluded from page 74.</i>)</h4>
    <p>Things were in this state when I visited S&mdash;&mdash;, and the union of Henri
    and Rosalie, though not positively fixed, was regarded as an event by no means
    distant. Every one was interested for the young and handsome couple, and wished for
    their espousal. Rosalie's friends longed for the day when she was to wed the young
    and handsome Henri; and Henri's comrades were perpetually urging him to cement his
    union with the lovely Rosalie.</p>
    <p>We left the place with every kind wish for the young and betrothed pair. I have
    not since revisited S&mdash;&mdash;, but by letters from my friend, I have been
    informed, that this commencement of their loves had a sad and melancholy sequel.</p>
    <p>After our departure, it seems, the lovers continued equally attached; arrangements
    were making for their union, and it was intended that Henri should leave the army
    previous to their marriage. But just at this juncture, and as he was about to leave
    his corps, rumours of war were circulated, the enterprise against Spain was
    projected, and the royal guard was one of the first corps ordered for service. Henri,
    with the natural enthusiasm of a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86"
    name="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>soldier, felt all his former ardour revive; and
    longed to mingle in the ranks of glory, ere he left them for ever. He, doubtless,
    felt severely the separation from Rosalie; yet his feelings were described to me as
    being of a joyous character, and as if evincing that he felt happy that the
    opportunity of joining his brethren in arms, and of signalizing himself perhaps for
    the last time, had presented itself, previous to his marriage and his quitting the
    service.</p>
    <p>The enterprise against Spain, he considered as the French army commonly did, to be
    a mere excursion of pleasure, which, while it led them into a country which many of
    them had never visited before, would also afford them the occasion of gathering
    laurels which might serve to redeem somewhat of their lost glory. He therefore looked
    forward to the expedition, on the whole, with feelings of ardour and delight, and
    even longed for its approach. Not so Rosalie! She looked on war and bloodshed with
    the natural apprehensions of her sex; and saw in the projected expedition, and its
    prospects of glory, only danger and death to her lover! Her spirits received a severe
    shock when the intelligence was first communicated&mdash;she gradually lost her
    cheerfulness and spirits; the song, the dance, had no longer charm or interest for
    her, and she could only contemplate the approaching separation with sorrow and
    dismay!</p>
    <p>Henri perceived her depression, and endeavoured to combat and remove her fears by
    arguments fond, but unavailing. It was only, he would urge, a jaunt of pleasure; it
    would admit his speedy return, when he would come to lay his services at her feet,
    and claim the hand which was already promised to his hopes; and surely, then, Rosalie
    could not regret his obeying the call of duty and of honour; or like her lover the
    worse, when crowned with victory in the cause of his country. To these and similar
    assurances, Rosalie could only reply with the mute eloquence of tears; and nothing
    could divest her of the apprehension with which she ever regarded an enterprise which
    she seemed to consider from the first as fatal.</p>
    <p>The time however drew on, the dreaded period arrived, the Royal Guard left its
    quarters, and departed from S&mdash;&mdash;. Henri took a fond and passionate adieu
    of his betrothed; and Rosalie, having summoned all her fortitude to her aid, went
    through the parting scene with more firmness than could have been expected from her,
    though her feelings, afterwards, were described as of the most agonizing kind.</p>
    <p>Such is the difference between the ardent feelings of man, and the tender and
    gentle sympathies of woman, that, while his sorrow is alleviated by a thousand
    mitigating circumstances of ardour and excitement, which relieve his attention, and
    soothe, though they do not annihilate his grief; she can only brood over her
    feelings, and suffer in silence and in sorrow. Henri marched out with his regiment in
    all the vigour of manhood, and with all the "pomp, pride, and circumstance of war,"
    while Rosalie could only retire to her chamber and weep.</p>
    <p>Time passed on; letters were received from Henri, which spoke in ardent terms of
    his journey, and of the new and singular scenes unfolded to his view. He adverted
    also to his return, mentioned the war as a mere pastime, and as an agreeable jaunt,
    the termination of which he only desired, because it would once more restore him to
    his Rosalie. It was remarked, however, that she never recovered her cheerfulness; to
    all her lover's assurances she could only reply with expressions of distrust, and
    with feelings of sorrow; and when she wrote, it was to express her fears of the
    campaign, and her wish that it were over, and that they were again united in
    safety.</p>
    <p>And constantly did the good and pious girl offer up her prayers for her lover, as
    she repaired to the church of the Holy Virgin at S&mdash;&mdash;, to perform her
    daily devotions.</p>
    <p>The season advanced: the French marched through Spain, and reached Cadiz. At this
    last hope of the Constitutionalists, a strong resistance was expected, and Henri had
    written from Seville, that his next letter would announce the termination of the
    campaign. Alas! he never wrote again! Time flew on; the journals announced the fall
    of the Trocadero; the surrender of Cadiz, and the restoration of Ferdinand; yet there
    came no news from Henri! Then did the gentle girl sink into all the despondency of
    disappointment; and as day after day passed and brought no tidings of her lover, her
    beauty and her health suffered alike, she languished and pined till she scarce
    retained the semblance of her former self.</p>
    <p>At last came a letter; it was from Spain, but it was written in a stranger's hand,
    and its sable appendages bespoke the fatal nature of its contents. It was from a
    brother officer of Henri, stating that his regiment had been foremost in the attack,
    and that the Trocadero, the last resource of the Constitutionalists, had been carried
    with the loss of but few killed; but, alas! among that few, was Henri! He was shot
    through the body while leading his men to the assault. He fell instantly dead, and
    the writer expressed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>[pg
    87]</span>his desire that the sad intelligence should be conveyed as gently as
    possible to Rosalie.</p>
    <p>Unhappily, by one of those chances which often occur, as if to aggravate
    misfortune, it was Rosalie who received the fatal letter from the postman's hands!
    She tore it open; read its dreadful contents; and with a wild and frenzied shriek,
    fell senseless to the ground! She was borne to her bed, where every care and
    attention was bestowed; but her illness rapidly assumed a threatening and a dangerous
    character. A fever seized her frame; she became at once delirious; nor did reason
    again resume her throne; and it was not till after months of suffering and agony,
    that she recovered, if that could be called recovery, which gave back a deformed and
    hapless lunatic, bereft of intellect and of beauty, in place of the once gay and
    fascinating Rosalie. The dread aberration of intellect was attributed by her medical
    attendants to the fatal and sudden shock which she had sustained, and to its effect
    on a mind weakened by previous anxiety and sorrow; while they feared her malady was
    of a nature, which admitted no hope of the return of reason.</p>
    <p>Her mind, it was stated, remained an entire blank. Imbecile, vacant,
    drivelling&mdash;she appeared almost unconscious of former existence; and of those
    subjects which formerly engrossed her attention, and excited her feelings, there were
    scarcely any on which she now evinced any emotion. Even the name of her lover was
    almost powerless on her soul, and if repeated in her hearing, seemed scarcely to call
    forth her notice.</p>
    <p>One only gift remained, in all its native pathos, tenderness, and beauty&mdash;her
    voice, so sweet before her illness, seemed, amid the wreck of youth, and joy, and
    love, and all that was charming and endeared, to have only become sweeter still! She
    was incapable or unwilling to learn any new airs, but she would occasionally
    recollect snatches of former songs or duets, which she and Henri had sung together,
    and she would pour the simple melodies in strains of more than mortal sweetness!</p>
    <p>This, alas! was the only relic of former talent or taste that she retained; in all
    other respects, her mind and body, instead of evincing symptoms of recovery, seemed
    to sink in utter hopelessness and despair; and an early tomb seems to be the best and
    kindest boon which heaven, in its mercy, can bestow, on the once fair and fascinating
    Rosalie!</p>

    <h3>TAVERNS AND CLUB-HOUSES.</h3>
    <p>Almost every tavern of note about town hath or had its club. The Mermaid Tavern is
    immortalized as the house resorted to by Shakspeare, Jonson, Fletcher, and Beaumont;
    the Devil&mdash;which, Pennant informs us, stood on the site of Child's-place, Temple
    Bar&mdash;was the scene of many a merry meeting of the choice spirits in old days; at
    Will's Coffee-house, in the Augustan age of English literature, societies were held
    to which Steele, and Pope, and Addison belonged; Doctor Johnson, Hawkesworth, the
    elder Salter, and Sir John Hawkins, were members of a club formerly held at the
    King's-head, in Ivy-lane; the notorious Dick England, Dennis O'Kelly, and Hull, with
    their associates, had, many years ago, a sporting-club at Munday's Coffee-house; the
    Three Jolly Pigeons, in Butcher-hall-lane, was formerly the gathering place of a set
    of old school bibliopoles, who styled themselves the Free and Easy Counsellors under
    the Cauliflower; stay-maker Hugh Kelly, Goldsmith, Ossian Macpherson, Garrick,
    Cumberland, and the Woodfalls, with several noted men of that day, were concerned in
    a club at the St. James's Coffee-house; the Kit-Cat, which took its name from one
    Christopher Cat, a pastry-cook, was held at a tavern in King-street, Westminster;
    Button's&mdash;but truly the task of enumerating the several clubs, of which we find
    notices "in the books," as the lawyers have it, would be endless.&mdash;<i>Every
    Night Book</i>.</p>
    <h3>CONVERSATION OF WOMEN.</h3>
    <p>The usual conversation of ordinary women very much cherishes the natural weakness
    of being taken with outside appearance. Talk of a new-married couple, and you
    immediately hear whether they keep their coach-and-six, or eat in plate. Mention the
    name of an absent lady, and it is ten to one but you learn something of her gown and
    petticoat. A ball is a great help to discourse, and a birthday furnishes conversation
    for a twelvemonth after. A furbelow of precious stones, a hat buttoned with a
    diamond, a brocade waistcoat or petticoat, are standing topics.
    &mdash;<i>Addison</i>.</p>
    <h3>BILDERDYK.</h3>
    <p>William Bilderdyk, admired as the first poet that modern Holland has produced,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>and not less
    distinguished by the brilliant qualities of his mind, did not, in his youth, seem to
    show any happy disposition for study. His father, who formed an unfavourable opinion
    of his talents, was much distressed, and frequently reproached him in severe terms
    for his inattention and idleness, to which young Bilderdyk did not appear to pay much
    attention. In 1776, the father, with a newspaper in his hand, came to stimulate him,
    by showing the advertisement of a prize offered by the Society of Leyden, and decreed
    to the author of a piece of poetry, signed with these words, "An Author 18 years
    old," who was invited to make himself known. "You ought to blush, idler," said old
    Bilderdyk to his son. "Here is a boy only of your age, and though so young, is the
    pride and happiness of his parents; and you&mdash;&mdash;." "It is myself," answered
    young William, throwing himself into his father's arms.</p>
    <h3>SIR ANTHONY CARLISLE,</h3>
    <p>Who has often filled the anatomical chair at the Royal Academy, is no less
    abstruse and instructive than pleasant and amusing. His illustrative anecdotes are
    always excellent, and his way of telling them quite dramatic. We have found him even
    more agreeable as a private talker than as a lecturer; he is rich in the old lore of
    England&mdash;he will hunt a phrase through several reigns&mdash;propose derivations
    for words which are equally ingenious and learned&mdash;follow a proverb for
    generations back, and discuss on the origin of language as though he had never
    studied aught beside: he knows more than any other person we ever met with of the
    biography of talented individuals&mdash;in the philosophy of common life he is quite
    an adept&mdash;a capital chronologist&mdash;a man of fine mind and most excellent
    memory: his experience has, of course, been very great, and he has taken good
    advantage of it. We remember he once amused us for half a day by adducing instances
    of men who, although possessed of mean talents, had enabled themselves to effect
    wonders, by simply hoarding in their minds, and subsequently acting upon, an immense
    number of facts: from this subject we naturally enough fell into a discourse on the
    importance, in many cases and situations, of attending to trifles. As a proof of
    this, he mentioned a circumstance which occurred to an eminent surgeon within his own
    memory; it was as follows: A gentleman, residing about a post-stage from town, met
    with an accident which eventually rendered amputation of a limb indispensable. The
    surgeon alluded to was requested to perform the operation, and went from town with
    two pupils to the gentleman's house, on the day appointed, for that purpose. The
    usual preliminaries being arranged, he proceeded to operate; the tourniquet was
    applied, the flesh divided, and the bone laid bare, when, to his astonishment and
    horror, he discovered that his instrument-case was without the saw! Here was a
    situation! Luckily his presence of mind did not forsake him. Without apprising his
    patient of the terrible fact, he put one of his pupils into his carriage, and told
    the coachman to gallop to town. It was an hour and a half before the saw was
    obtained, and during all that time the patient lay suffering. The agony of the
    operator, though great, was scarcely a sufficient punishment for his neglect in not
    seeing that all his instruments were in the case before he started.</p>
    <p>Basil Montagu, the water drinking barrister, who was present during the narration
    of this anecdote, and the previous discussion, mentioned another instance of the
    propriety of noticing those minor circumstances in life, which are usually suffered
    to pass unheeded by people in general. A man of talent was introduced into a company
    of strangers; he scarcely spoke after his first salutation until he wished the party
    good night. Almost every one dubbed him a fool; the lady hostess, who, be it
    remarked, had not been previously informed of the abilities of her new guest, was of
    a different opinion, "I am sure," said she, "that you are all wrong; for, though he
    said nothing, I remarked that <i>he always laughed in the right
    place</i>."&mdash;<i>Every Night Book</i>.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>A FACT.</h3>
    <blockquote class="poetry">
      Pat went to his mistress: "My lady, your mare<br />

    <p>This is the month of harvest. The crops usually begin with rye and oats, proceed
    with wheat, and finish with pease and beans. Harvest-home is still the greatest rural
    holiday in England, because it concludes at once the most laborious and most
    lucrative of the farmer's employments, and unites repose and profit. Thank heaven,
    there are, and must be, seasons of some repose in agricultural employments, or the
    countryman would work with as unceasing a madness, and contrive to be almost as
    diseased and unhealthy as the citizen. But here again, and for the reasons already
    mentioned, our holiday-making is not what it was. Our ancestors used to burst into an
    enthusiasm of joy at the end of harvest, and even mingled their previous labour with
    considerable merry-making, in which they imitated the equality of the earlier ages.
    They crowned the wheat-sheaves with flowers, they sung, they shouted, they danced,
    they invited each other, or met to feast as at Christmas, in the halls of rich
    houses; and, what was a very amiable custom, and wise beyond the commoner wisdom that
    may seem to lie on the top of it, every one that had been concerned, man, woman, and
    child, received a little present, ribbons, laces, or sweetmeats.</p>
    <p>The number of flowers is now sensibly diminished. Those that flower newly are
    nigella, zinnias, polyanthuses, love-apples, mignonette, capsicums, Michaelmas
    daisies, auriculus, asters or stars, and China-asters. The additional trees and
    shrubs in flower are the tamarisk, altheas, Venetian sumach, pomegranates, the
    beautiful passion-flower, the trumpet flower, and the virgin's bower or clematis,
    which is such a quick and handsome climber. But the quantity of fruit is considerably
    multiplied, especially that of pears, peaches, apricots, and grapes. And if the
    little delicate white flowers have at last withdrawn from the hot sun, the wastes,
    marshes, and woods are dressed in the luxuriant attire of ferns and heaths, with all
    their varieties of green, purple, and gold. A piece of waste land, especially where
    the ground is broken up into little inequalities, as Hampstead-heath, for instance,
    is now a most bright as well as picturesque object; all the ground, which is in
    light, giving the sun, as it were, gold for gold. Mignonette, intended to flower in
    winter, should now be planted in pots, and have the benefit of a warm situation.
    Seedlings in pots should have the morning sunshine, and annuals in pots be frequently
    watered.</p>
    <p>In the middle of this month, the young goldfinch broods appear, lapwings

    <h3>LEOPARD-HUNTING.</h3>
    <p>The leopard of Southern Africa is known among the Cape colonists by the name of
    tiger; but is, in fact, the real leopard, the <i>Felis jubata</i> of naturalists,
    well known for the beauty of its shape and spotted skin, and the treachery and
    fierceness of its disposition. The animal called leopard (<i>luipaard</i>) by the
    Cape Dutch boors, is a species of the panther, and is inferior to the real leopard in
    size and beauty. Both of them are dreaded in the mountainous districts on account of
    the ravages which they occasionally commit among the flocks, and on the young cattle
    and horses in the breeding season.</p>
    <p>The South African panther is a cowardly animal, and, like the hyena, flies from
    the face of man. The leopard also, though his low, half-smothered growl is frequently
    heard by night, as he prowls like an evil spirit around the cottage or the kraal,
    will seldom or never attack mankind, (children excepted,) unless previously assailed
    or exasperated. When hunted, as he usually is with dogs, he instinctively betakes
    himself to a tree, when he falls an easy prey to the shot of the huntsman. The
    leopard, however, though far inferior in strength and intrepidity to the lion, is yet
    an exceedingly active and furious animal; and when driven to extremity, proves
    himself occasionally an antagonist not to be trifled with. The colonists relate many
    instances of arduous and even fatal encounters with the hunted leopard. The following
    is one of these adventures, which occurred in a frontier district in 1822, as
    described by one of the two individuals so perilously engaged in it.</p>
    <p>Two boors returning from hunting the Hartebeest, (<i>antelope bubalis</i>,) fell
    in with a leopard in a mountain ravine, and immediately gave chase to him. The animal
    at first endeavoured to escape by clambering up a precipice; but being hotly pressed,
    and slightly wounded by a musket-ball, he turned upon his pursuers with that frantic
    ferocity which on such emergencies he frequently displays, and springing upon the man
    who had fired at him, tore him from his horse to the ground, biting him at the same
    time very severely in the shoulder, and tearing his face and arms with his talons.
    The other hunter, seeing the danger of his comrade, (he was, if I mistake not, his
    brother,) sprung from his horse, and attempted to shoot the leopard through the head;
    but, whether owing to trepidation, or the fear of wounding his friend, or the sudden
    motions of the animal, he unfortunately missed.</p>
    <p>The leopard, abandoning his prostrate enemy, darted with redoubled fury upon this
    second antagonist; and so fierce and sudden was his onset, that before the boor could
    stab him with his hunting-knife, he had struck him in the eyes with his claws, and
    torn the scalp over his forehead. In this frightful condition the hunter grappled
    with the raging beast, and struggling for life, they rolled together down a steep
    declivity. All this passed so rapidly, that the other boor had scarcely time to
    recover from the confusion in which his feline foe had left him, to seize his gun,
    and rush forward to aid his comrade, when he beheld them rolling together down the
    steep bank in mortal conflict. In a few moments he was at the bottom with them, but
    too late to save the life of his friend. The leopard had torn open the jugular vein,
    and so dreadfully mangled the throat of the unfortunate man, that his death was

    <h3>ON READING NEW BOOKS.</h3>
    <p>There is a fashion in reading as well as in dress, which lasts only for a season.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>One would
    imagine that books were, like women, the worse for being old;<a id="footnotetag2"
    name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> that they have a
    pleasure in being read for the first time; that they open their leaves more
    cordially; that the spirit of enjoyment wears out with the spirit of novelty; and
    that, after a certain age, it is high time to put them on the shelf. This conceit
    seems to be followed up in practice. What is it to me that another&mdash;that
    hundreds or thousands have in all ages read a work? Is it on this account the less
    likely to give me pleasure, because it has delighted so many others? Or can I taste
    this pleasure by proxy? Or am I in any degree the wiser for their knowledge? Yet this
    might appear to be the inference. <i>Their</i> having read the work may be said to
    act upon us by sympathy, and the knowledge which so many other persons have of its
    contents deadens our curiosity and interest altogether. We set aside the subject as
    one on which others have made up their minds for us, (as if we really could have
    ideas in their heads,) and are quite on the alert for the next new work, teeming hot
    from the press, which we shall be the first to read, to criticise, and pass an
    opinion on. Oh, delightful! To cut open the leaves, to inhale the fragrance of the
    scarcely-dry paper, to examine the type, to see who is the printer, (which is some
    clue to the value that is set upon the work,) to launch out into regions of thought
    and invention never trod till now, and to explore characters that never met a human
    eye before&mdash;this is a luxury worth sacrificing a dinner party, or a few hours of
    a spare morning to. Who, indeed, when the work is critical and full of expectation,
    would venture to dine out, or to face a <i>coterie</i> of blue stockings in the
    evening, without having gone through this ordeal, or at least without, hastily
    turning over a few of the first pages while dressing, to be able to say that the
    beginning does not promise much, or to tell the name of the heroine?</p>
    <p>A new work is something in our power; we mount the bench, and sit in judgment on
    it; we can damn or recommend it to others at pleasure, can decry or extol it to the
    skies, and can give an answer to those who have not yet read it, and expect an
    account of it; and thus show our shrewdness and the independence of our taste before
    the world have had time to form an opinion. If we cannot write ourselves, we become,
    by busying ourselves about it, a kind of <i>accessaries after the fact</i>. Though
    not the parent of the bantling that "has just come into this breathing world, scarce
    half made up," without the aid of criticism and puffing, yet we are the gossips and
    foster-nurses on the occasion, with all the mysterious significance and
    self-importance of the tribe. If we wait, we must take our report from others; if we
    make haste, we may dictate ours to them. It is not a race, then, for priority of
    information, but for precedence in tattling and dogmatising. The work last out is the
    first that people talk and inquire about. It is the subject on the
    <i>tapis</i>&mdash;the cause that is pending. It is the last candidate for success,
    (other claims have been disposed of,) and appeals for this success to us, and us
    alone. Our predecessors can have nothing to say to this question, however they may
    have anticipated us on others; future ages, in all probability, will not trouble
    their heads about it; we are the panel. How hard, then, not to avail ourselves of our
    immediate privilege to give sentence of life or death&mdash;to seem in ignorance of
    what every one else is full of&mdash;to be behind-hand with the polite, the knowing,
    and fashionable part of mankind&mdash;to be at a loss and dumb-founded, when all
    around us are in their glory, and figuring away, on no other ground than that of
    having read a work that we have not! Books that are to be written hereafter cannot be
    criticised by us; those that were written formerly have been criticised long ago; but
    a new book is the property, the prey of ephemeral criticism, which it darts
    triumphantly upon; there is a raw thin air of ignorance and uncertainty about it, not
    filled up by any recorded opinion; and curiosity, impertinence, and vanity rush
    eagerly into the vacuum. A new book is the fair field for petulance and coxcombry to
    gather laurels in&mdash;the butt set up for roving opinion to aim at. Can we wonder,
    then, that the circulating libraries are besieged by literary dowagers and their
    grand-daughters, when a new novel is announced? That mail-coach copies of the
    <i>Edinburgh Review</i> are or were coveted? That the manuscript of the
    <i>Waverley</i> romances is sent abroad in time for the French, German, or even
    Italian translation to appear on the same day as the original work, so that the
    longing continental public may not be kept waiting an instant longer than their
    fellow-readers in the English metropolis, which would be as tantalizing and
    insupportable as a little girl being kept without her new frock, when her sister's is
    just come home, and is the talk and admiration of every one in the house? To be sure,
    there is something in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>[pg
    92]</span>taste of the times; a modern work is expressly adapted to modern readers.
    It appeals to our direct experience, and to well-known subjects; it is part and
    parcel of the world around us, and is drawn from the same sources as our daily
    thoughts. There is, therefore, so far, a natural or habitual sympathy between us and
    the literature of the day, though this is a different consideration from the mere
    circumstance of novelty. An author now alive, has a right to calculate upon the
    living public; he cannot count upon the dead, nor look forward with much confidence
    to those that are unborn. Neither, however, is it true that we are eager to read all
    new books alike; we turn from them with a certain feeling of distaste and distrust,
    unless they are recommended to us by some peculiar feature or obvious distinction.
    Only young ladies from the boarding-school, or milliners' girls, read all the new
    novels that come out. It must be spoken of or against; the writer's name must be well
    known or a great secret; it must be a topic of discourse and a mark for
    criticism&mdash;that is, it must be likely to bring us into notice in some
    way&mdash;or we take no notice of it. There is a mutual and tacit understanding on
    this head. We can no more read all the new books that appear, than we can read all
    the old ones that have disappeared from time to time.&mdash;<i>Monthly
    Magazine</i>.</p>

    <h2>THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>THE PALACE OF ALI PASHA.</h3>
    <p>The secretary carried us through several chambers, decorated with much cost and
    barbarous splendour. The wainscot of one of the principal saloons is inlaid with
    mother-of-pearl, ebony, coral, and ivory; but the workmanship seems harsh and
    ungraceful. The ceiling is plastered with massive gilding, the effect of which is
    rather cumbrous than ornamental; "not graced with elegancy, but daubed with cost."
    Pillars, of a composition to resemble the richest marble, support the compartments,
    and the cornice is coloured with some imperfect efforts at arabesque painting. There
    is, however, one article extremely elegant and well-finished&mdash;a low sofa,
    carried round three-fourths of the room, covered with dark velvet, tastefully
    embroidered, and hung with gold fringe. The general arrangement of the rooms is
    certainly, grand and imposing, though occasionally deformed by much bad taste. I
    should not omit to mention, that our conductor desired us to notice two very handsome
    carpets, which he gave us to understand were of British manufacture. In the apartment
    where Ali sleeps, the walls are hung with sabres and fire-arms of different
    descriptions; all of which are ornamented with precious stones. One of the scimitars
    is profusely adorned with diamonds and rubies, and a particular musket has a
    cartouche-box, studded with brilliants of surpassing splendour, the central stone
    being nearly the size of a die. A fowling-piece, sent to the pasha by Bonaparte, is
    also enriched with gems, though this last article is considered to derive its chief
    value from the circumstance of having been once the property of the imperial warrior,
    by whom it was presented. The chamber opens into a long and spacious gallery; at one
    extremity we observed a singularly awkward piece of furniture, resembling a large
    old-fashioned arm-chair. So useless an article in a Turkish palace induced me to
    inquire the purpose to which it was applied; and I was informed that, on certain
    festivals, the pasha gives an entertainment for the diversion of the children of the
    principal families in the capital, who on such occasions assemble in the gallery. Ali
    himself always attends, to encourage and assist their gaiety; and, while reclining on
    this cumbrous seat, distributes to them, as they are successively presented to him,
    baskets of sweetmeats, and such other tokens of regard as are suited to their
    respective ages and condition.&mdash;<i>Narrative of an Excursion from Corfu to
    Smyrna</i>.</p>

    <h3>POLICE OFFICES AND POLICE REPORTS.</h3>
    <p>The police reports are frequently the most amusing part of the daily press: they
    let the reader into many of the secrets of low, and, now and then, of high life; they
    are redolent of the phraseology of the vulgar; they often tickle our fancies by their
    humour, and sometimes touch our sympathies by their pathos. As anecdotes of real
    life; daily catalogues of droll and dismal occurrences among our fellow-citizens;
    pictures of what is passing in the streets while we, who are sober sort of folks, are
    dreaming in our beds; sketches of manners, and records of the habits, feelings, and
    minor as well as major delinquencies of those who breathe the same air with us; they
    could not fail to be interesting to us all, were we not aware that, like the novels
    which are said to be "founded on fact," their most rich and racy parts are frequently
    fiction.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>Let not the
    non-gnostic portion of our readers imagine, that if they haunt the justice-seat of
    Birnie and his judicial co-mates, that they will ever witness such pleasant,
    sparkling, humorous examinations as those reported in the columns of the papers which
    matinally grace their breakfast-tables. The tyro upon town will stare at this. Why,
    will he say, cannot I, if I frequent the same place, see and hear what those who are
    employed for the press see and hear there? He can; but the fact is, that our police
    reporters are by far too clever to set down the words of other people, without
    throwing in something of their own. Their plan is to drop the duller parts of a story
    or a speech, and to embellish its livelier portion&mdash;to select the tit-bits, and
    sauce and spice them up sufficiently high to please the palates of the news-reading
    public. The offices afford them an excellent variety of characters, which, like
    skilful dramatists, they work up until they become really humorous: many of the cases
    afford them capital plots, into which they cleverly dovetail pleasant little
    episodes, and adhere no closer to the deposed facts than many of our by-gone
    playwrights have done to the sacred page of history. We allude only to the cases of
    humour which occur at the police-offices: those reports which can be interesting only
    in proportion as they are correct, are, in general, accurately given; but the
    matrimonial squabbles, the Irish far&ccedil;ettas, and the frays between the
    Dogberrys of the night and late walkers&mdash;albeit they may, peradventure, contain
    the leading facts disclosed&mdash;are highly wrought up by the fanciful powers of
    those who cause the public and feed themselves at a per-line-age for the daily press.
    Many cases which, on hearing, are dull and oftentimes disgusting, under the magic
    pens of the police-office scribes become lively and entertaining; they are furnished
    with the raw material&mdash;the metal in its ore&mdash;which they purify and polish,
    until it bears little or no resemblance to what it was before it underwent the
    process of manufacturing for the paper-market under their skilful hands. There are
    many who delight to visit the police-offices for the sake of seeing those beings who
    appear there, of whom others only read: some of our readers may, perhaps, be bitten
    with a similar fancy; but, we warrant, that they will find the actual doings at
    Bow-street very different to what they had imagined; as Charles Mathews' <i>Sir Harry
    Skelton</i> says, "There's nothing at all in it; people talk a great deal about
    it&mdash;but there's nothing in it, after all&mdash;nothing."</p>
    <p>It is not often that we look in at morning or evening sitting of the magistrates;
    we are content to have the police reports served up to us with our potted beef and
    buttered toast at breakfast; we enjoy them, although we feel convinced that many of
    them bear no more resemblance to the affairs they are founded on, than mock-turtle to
    calf's-head; still, like the soup, they are by far the most pleasant and palatable of
    the two.&mdash;<i>Every Night Book</i>.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>THE CURRAL.</h3>
    <p>The view in front was obstructed by a high ridge, of which we had nearly gained
    the highest point, when we left our horses, and running up a few yards of steep turf
    found ourselves all at once on the brink of the Curral. It is a huge valley, or
    rather crater, of immense depth, enclosed on all sides by a range of magnificent
    mountain precipices, the sides and summit of which are broken in every variety of
    buttress or pinnacle&mdash;now black and craggy and beetling&mdash;at other times
    spread with the richest green turf, and scattered with a profusion of the evergreen
    forest-trees, indigenous to the island; while far below, in the midst of all these
    horrors, smiles a fairy region of cultivation and fruitfulness, with a church and
    village, the white cabins of which seem half smothered in the luxuriance of their own
    vines and orchards.</p>
    <p>We gazed long and eagerly at the prospect. It is not easy to give an accurate
    notion of its peculiar character; and even painting would but ill assist, for one of
    the most striking features is the great and sudden <i>depth</i> which you look down,
    the effect of which we know the pencil cannot at all convey. The side on which we
    stand, however, though steep, is not absolutely precipitous; on the contrary, the
    gradation of crag and projection, by which it descends to the bottom, is one of the
    finest things in the view. Close on our right a lofty peak presents its rocky face to
    the valley, to which it bears down in a magnificent mass, shouldering its way, as it
    seemed, half across it. The opposite sides appear more bare, precipitous, and lofty;
    and this last character is heightened by some white clouds that rest upon and conceal
    their summits.</p>
    <p>Rejoining the road, we for awhile lost sight of the valley. When we again came in
    view of it, it was rapidly filling with clouds, but at first their interposition was
    hardly a disadvantage; they gave a vague indefinite grandeur to the cliffs and
    mountains, which seemed to rise one knew not from what depth, and lose their <span
    class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>summits in regions
    beyond our ken. The breaks, too, that occurred in this shrouding of the scene, showed
    fragments of it with strange effect&mdash;till at length the whole hollow filled, and
    presented a uniform sea of vapour.</p>
    <p><i>Rambles in Madeira</i>.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>A PORTUGUESE BALL.</h3>
    <p>The ladies are carried in palanquins, and each received at the street entrance by
    the master of the house&mdash;or if there be more than one lady, by some gentlemen
    deputed for that purpose&mdash;who takes her hand, and so ushers her up stairs. There
    is much of this elaborate gallantry observable in the manner of the Portuguese
    towards the sex. Thus, a man never passes a lady in the street, or in her balcony,
    without taking off his hat, and this whether he be acquainted with her or not. We
    understand they used to offer a similar mark of respect to the English ladies, but
    desisted on finding that our gentlemen did not reciprocate in the same homage towards
    the fair <i>Portuguezas</i>. I don't think that this difference in the manners of the
    two people does us credit. Not that all that kind of homage means much. In this, as
    in a more serious concern, our southern neighbours may seem to have the advantage in
    the practices of external devotion; but it would be a mistake to infer from thence,
    that there is with us less of that service of the heart, which, after all, is the one
    thing needful. The party was large, probably two hundred, including most of the
    native rank and fashion of the island. We found the ladies all seated together in one
    room, and the effect of this concentration was sufficiently dazzling. Some people
    deny that there is any standard of female beauty; and, at any rate, there is no doubt
    but that habits and associations, as well as complexional and sentimental
    considerations, interfere more with our perceptions in respect to this than any other
    object of taste. It is not immediately that we enter into the merits of a style of
    beauty very different from that which we have been accustomed to. Perhaps it is owing
    to this circumstance that I was not struck by so many instances of individual
    attractiveness as might have been expected in so crowded a galaxy. The traits that
    first strike a stranger in a Portuguese belle, are the tendency to <i>embonpoint</i>
    in the figure, and to darkness&mdash;I had almost said swarthiness, in complexion.
    This last character, however, is not particularly obvious by candle-light; and it is
    always relieved by the most raven hair, and eyes such as one seldom sees elsewhere,
    so large and black; if their fire were softened by a longer lash, and their
    expression less fixed, there would be no resisting them. I fancy, too, that their
    effect would be rather greater in a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> than in a
    circle like this, where, looking round, one sees on all sides the same eyes&mdash;and
    which all (it is everywhere the reproach of black eyes) say always the same thing.
    Their dress was perfectly in the English fashion; and, in general, there was
    something not un-English in their <i>mise</i> and <i>tournure</i>. The superiority of
    French women in these matters is incontestable. Perhaps we may account for it
    something on the principle by which Dr. Johnson explained the excellence of our
    neighbours in cookery, when he suspected that the inferiority of their meats rendered
    indispensable some extraordinary skill in dressing it. The general arrangement and
    progress of the evening was very English too. They dance remarkably well, the men as
    well as the women. Indeed, it is, I believe, the great end and occupation of the
    earlier part of their existence. We came away at two o'clock; few of the English
    staid later; but among the Portuguese, the more ardent spirits kept up the dance till
    long after day-break, when it is customary to serve up <i>caldo</i>, a sort of
    chicken-broth, for their refreshment.&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</h3>
    <p><i>What is a Lawyer?</i>&mdash;A lawyer is a man with a pale face and sunken eyes;
    he passes much time in two small rooms in one of the inns of court; he is surrounded
    with sheets of foolscap folio paper, tied up with a red string; he has more books
    than one could read in a year, or comprehend in seven; he walks slowly, speaks
    hesitatingly, and receives fees from those who visit him, for giving "hypothetical
    answers" to "specious questions."</p>
    <p><i>What is a Doctor?</i>&mdash;A doctor, <i>videlicit</i> an M.D., is a
    sedate-looking personage; he listens calmly to the story of your ailments; if your
    eye and skin be yellow, he shrewdly remarks that you have the jaundice; he feels your
    pulse, writes two or three unintelligible lines of Latin, for which you pay him a
    guinea; he keeps a chariot, and one man-servant. The standard board behind,
    <i>intended</i> for a footman, is fearfully beset with spikes, to prevent little boys
    from riding at the doctor's expense. He ingeniously lets himself in and out of his
    vehicle, by means of a strap attached to the steps, so contrived, that when in, he
    can dexterously <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>[pg
    95]</span>cause the steps to follow. His servant is a coachman abroad, and a footman,
    valet, and butler at home.</p>
    <p><i>What is an Author?</i>&mdash;He is a man who weaves words into sentences; he
    dissects the works of his predecessors and contemporaries, and ingeniously dovetails
    the pieces together again, so that their real owners can scarcely recognise them. He
    is furnished with a pair of scissors and a pot of paste. He frequents the Chapter
    Coffee-house by day, and the Cider-Cellar by night. He ruralises at Hampstead or
    Holloway, and perhaps once a year steams it to Margate. He talks largely, and forms
    the nucleus of a knot of acquaintances, who look up to him as an oracle. He is always
    <i>going</i> to set about some work of great importance; he writes a page, becomes
    out of humour with the subject, and begins another, which shares the same fate. His
    coat is something the worse for wear; his wife is the only person in the world who is
    blind to his transcendant abilities; and he has too much to do in cultivating his own
    genius, to descend to the minutias of his children's education.</p>
    <h3>SUPERSTITION.</h3>
    <p>In a little manual of piety, composed, in 1712, for the young ladies who were then
    pensioners at the monastery of St. Augustin, at Bruges, we have been surprised into
    frequent smiles by the scrupulous watchfulness with which the ghostly writer followed
    the lady-pensioners (though with pious fancy only) to the very sacred of sacreds! He
    was not contented with directing them concerning the prayers which he believed proper
    to be used when they assumed, or laid aside, their respective garments, but even
    directed them what to do before they attempted to close an eye on the softness of
    their pillows! Prayers are specified by this zealous pastor for the following curious
    occasions:&mdash;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In putting on your petticoat.</li>
      <li>In putting on your night-gown.</li>
      <li>In dressing your head.</li>
      <li>In putting on your manteau.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In regard to the ceremony of laying aside these memorials of the weakness of Eve,
    our general mother, there is a prayer to be offered "whilst you undress yourself;"
    and the ladies are strictly enjoined, before they "get into bed, to take holy water."
    The writer concludes this part of his instructions by saying, "when you are in bed,
    write the name of Jesus on your forehead with your thumb!"</p>
    <h3>CROMWELL.</h3>
    <p>After the battle of Marston, Cromwell, returning from the pursuit of a party of
    the royalists, purposed to stop at Ripley; and, having an officer in his troop, a
    relation of Sir William Ingilby's, that gentleman was sent to announce his arrival.
    The officer was informed, by the porter at the gate, that Sir William was absent, but
    that he might send any message he pleased to his lady. Having sent in his name, and
    obtained an audience, he was answered by the lady, that no such person should be
    admitted there; adding, she had force sufficient to defend herself and that house
    against all rebels. The officer, on his part, represented the extreme folly of making
    any resistance, and that the safest way would be to admit the general peaceably.
    After much persuasion, the lady took the advice of her kinsman, and received Cromwell
    at the gate of the lodge, with a pair of pistols stuck in her apron-strings, and
    having told him she expected that neither he nor his soldiers would behave
    improperly, led the way to the hall, where, sitting each on a sofa, these two
    extraordinary personages, equally jealous of each other's intentions, passed the
    whole night. At his departure in the morning the lady observed, "It was well he had
    behaved in so peaceable a manner; for that, had it been otherwise, he would not have
    left that house with his life."</p>
    <h3>HOWARD.</h3>
    <p>Of this celebrated man no portrait was ever painted, for he would never sit to any
    artist. After his return from one of his journies to the continent, he was showing to
    a friend the various things he had brought with him, and among others a new dress
    made in Saxony: "it was a sort of great coat, yet graceful in its appearance, and
    ornamented with sober magnificence. His visiter exclaimed, 'This is the robe in which
    you should be painted by Romney; I will implore the favour on my knees if you will
    let me array you in this very picturesque habiliment, and convey you instantly in a
    coach to Cavendish-square.'&mdash;'O fie!' replied Howard, in the mildest tone of his
    gentle voice, 'O fie! I did not kneel to the emperor.'&mdash;'And I assure you,' said
    the petitioner in answer to the tender reproof, 'I would never kneel to you, if you
    were not above an emperor in my estimation!' The philanthropist was touched by the
    cordial eulogy, but continued firm in his resolution of not granting his portrait to
    all the repeated requests of important affections."&mdash;<i>Hayley's Life of

    <p>Edward Drinker was born in a cottage in 1689, on the spot where the city <span
    class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>of Philadelphia now
    stands, which was inhabited at the time of his birth, by Indians, a few Swedes, and
    Hollanders. He often talked of picking blackberries, and catching wild rabbits, where
    this populous city is now seated. He remembered William Penn arriving there the
    second time, and used to point out the spot where the cabin stood in which Mr. Penn
    and his friends were accommodated on their arrival.</p>
    <p>The life of this aged citizen is marked with circumstances which never befel any
    other man; for he saw greater events than any man, at least, since the Patriarchs. He
    saw the same spot of earth, in the course of his own life, covered with woods and
    bushes, the receptacles of wild beasts and birds of prey, afterwards become the seat
    of a great city, not only the first in wealth and arts in America, but equalled by
    few in Europe; he saw great and regular streets, where he had often pursued hares and
    wild rabbits; he saw fine churches rise upon morasses, where he used to hear nothing
    but the croaking of frogs; great wharfs and warehouses, where he had so often seen
    the Indian savages draw their fish from the river; and that river afterwards full of
    great ships from all the world, which in his youth had nothing bigger than a canoe;
    and on the same spot, where he had so often gathered huckleberries, he saw their
    magnificent city hall erected, and that hall filled with legislators, astonishing the
    world with their wisdom and virtue. He also saw the first treaty ratified between the
    united powers of America, and the most powerful prince in Europe, with all the
    formality of parchment and seal; and on the same spot where he once saw William Penn
    ratify his first and last treaty with the Indians; and to conclude, he saw the
    beginning and end of the British empire in Pensylvania. He had been the subject of
    many crowned heads; but when he heard of the many oppressive and unconstitutional
    acts passed in Britain, he bought them all, and gave them to his great grandson to
    make kites of; and embracing the liberty and independence of his country in his
    withered arms, and triumphing in the last year of his life, in the salvation of his
    country. He died on the 17th of November, 1782, aged 103 years.</p>
    <h3>A SURE SIGN.</h3>
    <p>When the wind follows the sun and settles about north-west, north, or east, we
    have fine weather; when, on the contrary, the wind opposes the sun's course, and
    returns by west, south-west, south, and south-east, and settles in the east, foul
    weather prevails.</p>

    <p>A man of learning was complaining to Voltaire, that few foreigners relished the
    beauties of Shakspeare. "Sir," replied the wit, "bad translations torment and vex
    them, and prevent them understanding your great dramatist. A blind man, sir, cannot
    perceive the beauty of a rose, who only pricks his fingers with the thorns."</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The reign of Edward I. was marked with a singular occurrence, which serves to
    Illustrate the general character of this monarch. In the year 1285, Edward took away
    the charter of London, and turned out the mayor, in consequence of his suffering
    himself to be bribed by the bakers, and invested one of his own appointing with the
    civic authority. The city, however, by making various presents to the king, and
    rendering him other signal services, found means to have their charter restored.</p>

    a person sitting near him, who was astonished to perceive that he alone remained
    unaffected during, the most pathetic scene, the banker coolly replied, "I do not cry,

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, THE MIRROR OF LITERATURE, AMUSEMENT, AND INSTRUCTION, VOL. 10, ISSUE 267, AUGUST 4, 1827 ***

This file should be named 8m26710h.htm or 8m26710h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8m26711h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8m26710ah.htm


Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or
<a href="http://promo.net.pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
